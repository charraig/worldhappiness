## MATH 640 - Bayesian Statistics - Final Project

The 2017 World Happiness Report \cite{worldhappinessreport}, released on March 20, 2017, sought to globally measure happiness and understand the factors that might influence it, in order to aid policy makers in their decision-making process. The survey conducted by GWP (Gallup World Poll) collected data in 155 countries/territories and has been repeated yearly from 2005 through 2016. The happiness score, `life ladder` as recorded in the data, is the average response to survey answers asking respondents the Cantril Ladder question, i.e. “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

The data set also contains 23 other variables on economic, social, and health aspects of each country. In this study, we sought to better understand the relationship between a country's happiness and the various predictor variables. Therefore, we explore two main models: 
1. Classical linear regression: To model happiness against other economic, social, and health variables.
2. Longitudinal mixed effects: To model happiness through time.
